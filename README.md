# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even when data is provided.  The bug is related to how the component handles data updates and rendering.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple FlatList implementation. Despite the `DATA` array being populated and the `useEffect` hook ensuring data is set, the FlatList renders blank. This occurs because of a data update issue that needs to be addressed in the render flow.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file contains a solution to resolve this issue. This involved ensuring that data changes are properly triggering the render cycle.
